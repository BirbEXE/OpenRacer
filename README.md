This design was created from scratch but inspired by the brilliant CampfireQuads frame. Since the Campfire frame is not opensource and pilts wanted to imrove the design and to add things like support for a Caddx Vista, it was decided to create OpenRacer frame to share with the FPV community. Although this design has been tested by a number of people, we're always looking for ways to improve it. Please feel free to contribute ideas or submit your own designs!

You can order the frame carbon from [Cyclone FPV](https://www.cyclonefpv.com/collections/cyclone-fpv-frames-and-kits/products/openracer-5-inch-racing-frame) or [CNC Madness](https://cncmadness.com/). We will provide instructions for printing your own pod, but if you would like one printed we recommend [Phoenix 3D](https://www.phx-3d.com/)

Top and Bottom plates: 2.5mm carbon
Arms: 5mm carbon
Braces: 4mm carbon

Required screws, nuts, and standoffs:
```
- 8x pressnuts M3 (for top plate)
- 4x standoffs 10mm M3 (to mount canopy) rough surface preferably
- M3 plastic nuts X 4 (to secure FC/stack)

Titanium (Grade alloy if titanium not available):
- M3 Button head 12mm X 8 (mount motors through braces and arms)
- M3 Button head 8mm X 4 (mount motors through arms)
- M3 Button head 6mm X 4 (secure canopy from the top)

Alloy Steel (12.9 Gauge Alloy - the best. 10.9 grade also works.
Not aluminium, not titanium, not stainless steel)
- M3 Countersunk 16mm X 4 (arm mounting, goes through both plates, pressnut and standoff)
- M3 Countersunk 30mm X 4 (for 30x30 stack, goes through both plates)

Additional hardware for 20x20 stack builds:
- M3 Countersunk 12.9 Grade Alloy 12mm X 4 (to lock the arms instead of 30x30 stack screws)
- M3 Button head 20mm X 4 (Titanuim or Grade Alloy) (for 20x20 stack)

Extra for 25x25 AIO:
- M2 Button head 12mm X 4
```

The canopy can be printed in 95A shore hardness TPU. Nylon will be a little lighter and a little bit stiffer. We have also started experimenting with Nylon/TPE blends (Taulman PCTPE) which has so far proven to be a good middle ground of component protection and durability. It also can by dyed like normal nylon.

The analog version works with most of normal 20x20 and 30x30 stacks.
