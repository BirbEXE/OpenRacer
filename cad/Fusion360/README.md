## HDZero Clasic Parametric
[Download here](HDZero_Tank_V2_Parametric_v3.f3z)

This is the Fusion file for the HDZero Classic canopy.
It has parameters which let you set the size of the camera, body, lens, etc.
Please note that this is not well-tested, and currently contains parameters for the Runcam Nano 90 camera.
Activate the final two features in the design history to slice the canopy into a small printable test area.
